      <li>Peel the eggs carefully without damaging them and add into an air tight container where you’re going to store this dish. Pour the sauce mixture over the eggs, cover and store in a refrigerator for at least 6 hour to over night before serve. It will last 5 to 7 days in a refrigerator!</li>
      <li>Enjoy with warm cooked rice and a bit of drizzled sesame oil!</li>
